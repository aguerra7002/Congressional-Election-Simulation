# Congressional-Election-Simulation

This repository contains all of the spreadsheets that show the data/graphs for our simulations, and have the source code and necessary files needed to run the simulation in Eclipse or similar IDE. 

Note: to correctly utilize data from CongressionalDistricts.csv, you will need to change the PATH variable to follow the path to the csv file on your computer. This is at the towards the top of the "DistrictManager" class.
